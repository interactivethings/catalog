## 2.0.0

The great update to Catalog! 2.0.0 features a new visual appearance (and a logo!) and a major rewrite under the hood. There are many breaking changes, so you need to spend some time updating your documentation when migrating from 1.x.

:rocket: The biggest new thing is that **Catalog is now available as a npm module and can be integrated directly into a React application** to document components and styles. :rocket:

The standalone version still works the same way (with some small changes to the API and the configuration).

### Notable Changes

- The standalone version now is called with `Catalog.render(config, element)`
- All specimens now share a common configuration option `span-[1-6]` which allows them to be laid out in a grid
- React app integration
- Streamlined page configuration with helpful warnings in development mode
- Themable (experimental, API subject to change)

### New Specimens

- ColorPalette
- Image
- Video
- Audio
- Type
- Hint
- Download
- ReactSpecimen

### Removed Specimens

- HTML Project (no replacment yet)
- UISpec (replaced by Image, Video, Audio)
- Icon (replaced by Image)
