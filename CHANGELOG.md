# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### Added

ðŸš€ Catalog now comes with its own command line tool (see [#283](https://github.com/interactivethings/catalog/pull/283))!

This means getting started with Catalog is now as simple as typing `catalog start`.

- Catalog will work _alongside_ existing apps and detect [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) automatically
- Catalog will help you getting started by creating the necessary files when you run `catalog start` for the first time
- No configuration needed!
- Create an optimized build with `catalog build`

Other things:
- Provide a function (`Catalog.markdown`) which converts a template literal into a Page component [#277](https://github.com/interactivethings/catalog/pull/277), [#281](https://github.com/interactivethings/catalog/pull/281)
- New option on the image specimen: `scale`. See [#76](https://github.com/interactivethings/catalog/issues/76)
- Add a Babel plugin which preserves original source text of ReactSpecimen children [#285](https://github.com/interactivethings/catalog/pull/285)
- Enable imports in all Specimens ([#154](https://github.com/interactivethings/catalog/pull/154))

## 2.0.0

The great update to Catalog! 2.0.0 features a new visual appearance (and a logo!) and a major rewrite under the hood. There are many breaking changes, so you need to spend some time updating your documentation when migrating from 1.x.

:rocket: The biggest new thing is that **Catalog is now available as a npm module and can be integrated directly into a React application** to document components and styles. :rocket:

The standalone version still works the same way (with some small changes to the API and the configuration).

### Notable Changes

- The standalone version now is called with `Catalog.render(config, element)`
- All specimens now share a common configuration option `span-[1-6]` which allows them to be laid out in a grid
- React app integration
- Streamlined page configuration with helpful warnings in development mode
- Themable (experimental, API subject to change)

### New Specimens

- ColorPalette
- Image
- Video
- Audio
- Type
- Hint
- Download
- ReactSpecimen

### Removed Specimens
